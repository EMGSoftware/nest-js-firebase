This is a starter repository for who wants to start a Nest API project and host it with Firebase Cloud Functions.

### Prerequisites

First of all, you need to set the Firebase project inside .firebaserc, to do so just replace <project-id>. Then, you need the following tools installed globally.

* [Firebase tools](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/?hl=pt-br)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon/tutorial)

### How it works

* To build the app `$ npm run build`
* To run the server `$ npm run serve`
* To run the server for development `$ npm run serve:dev`
* To deploy it to Firebase `$ npm run deploy`
